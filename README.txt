An implementation of Formlets in C#, as defined by Ezra Cooper, Sam Lindley, Philip Wadler, and Jeremy Yallop.

See http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/ for reference.

This implementation is currently built on top of FsFormlets (https://github.com/mausch/FsFormlets) so you'll need the F# runtime.
